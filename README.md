I wrote these scripts to learn how Pillow works, but if you feel you can use it for your personal use, you are very much welcome.

## How to use

2. change the desktop location in the code
3. place all the images you need to blur, in a folder called `blur_this`, this folder should be in your desktop
4. run the script
