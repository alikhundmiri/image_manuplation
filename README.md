# Image Manuplation
All the scripts written for image manuplation, such as blur, resize, or image resolution manager.
## Created for personal Use
These scripts were written to learn how Pillow works, but if you feel you can use it for your personal use, you are very much welcome.

## All the Files (3)

### [sort_images.py](https://github.com/alikhundmiri/image_manuplation/blob/master/sort_images.py)
I recently started a new hobby of taking photos of the Moon, late in the night. For editing purpose it is suggested that we use RAW format to edit images. 

I prefer to keep my RAW files in a different directory. Simply.

This script's main purpose is to move RAW files ending with format `.NEF` to a new subfolder called `RAW`. This is suppose to save time when there are 100s of images in question.

#### how to use:
1. Change the BASE_DIR if you wish.
2. Inside the BASE_DIR make a folder and paste all the new images from DSLR
3. Run the Script
4. Enter the foolder name you created
